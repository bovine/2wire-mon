==Purpose==
I recently subscribed to the AT&T U-verse VDSL service, and it came
with a 2Wire 3800HGV-B router/gateway.

Naturally I wanted to be able to monitor and measure the utilization
of my connection so that I could verify that it was performing up to
expectations.  Unfortunately, these routers do not appear to support
SNMP, which is what one would normally use to monitor network
equipment.  Luckily the router provides a web-based administrative
interface that displays raw network metrics, which can be accessed by
the web-scraping technique described here.

This script will allow you to collect network utilization statistics
from a 2Wire DSL router/gateway and generate graphs of them.

==Prerequisites==

This has been developed and tested against a 2Wire 3800HGV-B Gateway
running version 5.29.105.94, but it might work with other 2Wire
models.  I would appreciate receiving some feedback if it does.

These scripts must be installed and configured to run from a separate
computer located behind your 2Wire gateway.  I have chosen to run them
from a Fedora 9 Linux system.  If you want to have continuous graphs,
you'll need to have this computer online and running all of the time.

You will need Perl, RRDtool, and the Perl RRD modules.  On
Redhat/Fedora/CentOS Linux systems, you can install these dependencies
with:

 yum install rrdtool rrdtool-perl

==Installation==

# Download and extract the tarball into a directory of your choice.  I
just run it from a "~/2wire/" sub-directory in my personal home
directory.

# Using a text editor, edit the "2wire.pl" script and change
the line near the top with your router's administrative password.

# Modify your crontab to run the "2wire.pl" and
"gengraphs.sh" at some regular interval.  I have them both
running once per minute, but you can choose to run them less
frequently if you want.  Edit your crontab by running "crontab -e"


Here is the crontab entry that I use:
 * * * * * cd ~/2wire && ./2wire.pl && ./gengraphs.sh

You may need to edit the "gengraphs.sh" script to change the
directory where the generated graphs should be saved.  If you are
familiar with the RRD graph syntax, you can also customize the
formatting and appearance of the graphs.
