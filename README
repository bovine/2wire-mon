This script will allow you to collect network utilization statistics
from a 2Wire DSL router/gateway and generate graphs of them. It
gathers the network information by requesting one of the monitoring
pages within the web administration user-interface and extracting the
raw byte totals, and then plotting the result using RRDtool.
